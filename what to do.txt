1. Users with differing permissions.
2. Users should have all accounts that are in the database linked to their account.
3. Profile should show all of this correctly
4. Trackmania implementation
	- Have the trackmania button lead to game-leaderboard-trackmania.ejs
	- redesign the trackmania leaderboard
		-- Should have small boxes with a leaderboard per map.
		-- Should show the top 10 players per leaderboard but you should be able to scroll
		-- Should show the map at the top of the leaderboard then show the player the time and if the time has been approved below.
		-- Should only show the five fastest time of any specific player.
	- redesign the input
		-- you should be able to choose from a selection box with a drop down menu a map to input your score for.
		-- you should be able to input your score in minutes, seconds, miliseconds
	- have a verification page where admins can verify all unverified runs or have them deleted
	- redesign the datapoints so it works with the concepts above, this includes a new datapoint named trackmania maps within which we put all maps that you can log.
		-- these maps should have a name and a status, with the status being if they are in the active or inactive map pool
	- a function similiar to how we add games to the database to be able to add maps to the pool
5. Security
	- Login
	- Logout
	- See who is logged in currently
	- Login screen go back
	- How to recover account.
	- What are the changes when you have an account, what permissions do what?
	- Data Tracking:
		-- Amount of logins
		-- Amount of games put into the database
		-- Every game that is input should be tracked by which user it was done.
		-- Every user should have certain accounts attached to them.
		   But only admins should be able to combine these accounts.
		   If someone puts a name into the submit player results it should then also be tracked.
		   If that name is part of a user and if so should be attributed to that user instead of the player.
		   (so if a player name is claimed it now belongs to that player, this also results in the merging of all those accounts.)
6. add a user section
