1. Users with differing permissions.
2. Users should have all accounts that are in the database linked to their account. [Not Done]
3. Profile should show all of this correctly [Not done]
4. Trackmania implementation [not done]
	- Have the trackmania button lead to game-leaderboard-trackmania.ejs
	- redesign the trackmania leaderboard
		-- Should have small boxes with a leaderboard per map.
		-- Should show the top 10 players per leaderboard but you should be able to scroll
		-- Should show the map at the top of the leaderboard then show the player the time and if the time has been approved below.
		-- Should only show the five fastest time of any specific player.
	- redesign the input
		-- you should be able to choose from a selection box with a drop down menu a map to input your score for.
		-- you should be able to input your score in minutes, seconds, miliseconds
	- have a verification page where admins can verify all unverified runs or have them deleted
	- redesign the datapoints so it works with the concepts above, this includes a new datapoint named trackmania maps within which we put all maps that you can log.
		-- these maps should have a name and a status, with the status being if they are in the active or inactive map pool
	- a function similiar to how we add games to the database to be able to add maps to the pool
	- the elo system for Trackmania should be putt in now.
5. Security
	- VERY IMPORTANT TO REMOVE THE GAME FROM THE USER DATAPOINT AND REMOVE IT FROM THE REGISTRATION ITS ANNOYING AS FUCK RIGHT NOW.
	- Login
	- Logout
	- See who is logged in currently
	- Login screen go back
	- How to recover account.
	- What are the changes when you have an account, what permissions do what?
	- Data Tracking:
		-- Amount of logins
		-- Amount of games put into the database
		-- Every game that is input should be tracked by which user it was done.
		-- Every user should have certain accounts attached to them.
6. Add a user section
